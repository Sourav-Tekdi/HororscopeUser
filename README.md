# Simple React App with Auto Deployment

This is a simple React application with auto-deployment to a Hostinger server.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm 8 or later

## Setup Automatic Deployment

To set up automatic deployment using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

1. **Push this code to a GitHub repository**
   
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub Secrets**
   
   In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions and add these secrets:
   
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private SSH key for connecting to the server
   - `KNOWN_HOSTS`: The SSH known hosts entry for your server (run `ssh-keyscan 69.62.78.171` to get this)

3. **First-time SSH Setup**
   
   Ensure your SSH key is added to the authorized keys on your Hostinger server:
   
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id root@69.62.78.171
   ```

## Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using the included deployment script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will build the app and deploy it to your Hostinger server at 69.62.78.171.

## Development

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm start
```

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
